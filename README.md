This is a chess game made with pygame.

To run the game, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the code is saved. Then type the following command:

```
python main.py
```

The game will start and you can play it by clicking on the squares on the chessboard.

Here are some explanations of the code:

* The `pygame` library is used to create the graphics and handle the user input.
* The `chessboard` is a 2D list that represents the chessboard. Each element of the list is a string that represents the piece that is on that square.
* The `draw_board()` function draws the chessboard on the screen.
* The `handleClick()` function handles the logic for when the user clicks on a square on the chessboard.
* The `get_moves()` function returns a list of all the possible moves for a given piece.

I hope this helps!

This is a simple chess game made with Pygame.

To run the game, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the files. Then, type the following command:

```
python main.py
```

The game will start and you can play it by clicking on the squares on the chessboard.

Here are some explanations of the code:

* The `pygame` module is used to create the graphics and handle the user input.
* The `chessBoard` variable is a 2D list that represents the chessboard. Each element in the list is a string that represents the piece that is on that square.
* The `draw_board()` function draws the chessboard on the screen.
* The `handleClick()` function handles the logic for when the user clicks on a square on the chessboard.

I hope this helps!
